## Project Name
RabbitMQ Order Processing System

##Project Description
Designed and implemented an event-driven order processing system using RabbitMQ and ASP.NET Core. The solution consists of a publisher API that emits order creation events and a background consumer service that processes those events asynchronously. The system ensures reliable message delivery using manual acknowledgements, retry queues with delay, and dead-letter queues for failure handling. The messaging flow was tested end-to-end using Swagger and RabbitMQ Management UI.

## Project Domain
Backend Systems / Event-Driven Architecture / Messaging

## My Responsibilities
- Designed RabbitMQ messaging topology (direct exchange, durable queues, retry queue with TTL, dead-letter queue)
- Implemented an ASP.NET Core Web API for publishing domain events to RabbitMQ
- Implemented a .NET Worker Service consumer for background message processing
- Added manual message acknowledgements, QoS/prefetch configuration, and retry logic
- Handled JSON serialization/deserialization and schema validation
- Tested and validated message flow using RabbitMQ Management UI and Swagger

## Technology Stack
C#, .NET 8, ASP.NET Core Web API, .NET Worker Service, RabbitMQ, Docker, System.Text.Json, Swagger, Microsoft.Extensions.Logging
